Today, that positivity rate has shot up to 6.9%. Put another way, tests for the coronavirus are 57% more likely to be positive today than they were just two weeks ago. We're seeing the same trend in California, where the rate has increased And more people are being hospitalized. In California, there are more people with confirmed cases of COVID-19 in hospitals than at any time in three months. While the health of Americans and of Californians, in particular, is suffering as we reopen the economy, Trump and Pence continue downplaying the danger of the virus. The vice president suggests that the surge is due only to increased testing. The president ignores health experts as he refuses to wear a mask. Their message: No problem here, let's move on. Consequently, the virus spread continues -- and at a faster rate. It's not just Trump and Pence who are disseminating misguided messages. Gov. Gavin Newsom continues to try to walk a political tightrope rather than acting decisively. After a strong start pushing residents to stay home if they did n't need to go out, he then let the state rapidly reopen. Then when cases -- predictably -- started quickly rising, he required wearing of masks in public, the weekend closed bars in some counties, a seemingly random action. Why bars? Why not construction sites or restaurants? That would require analyzing the occupations of coronavirus cases. There's no sign the state is doing such an analysis. Meanwhile, it balks at releasing data so others could. Equally disconcerting is the message coming from Contra Costa. On Monday, health officials there reported coronavirus hospitalizations had increased 75% in the past two weeks. The number of daily cases had doubled. And the rate of positive test results had surged from 4% to 6%. The county's response? Delay further reopenings that had been scheduled for Thursday. That's a no-brainer, but it's not nearly enough. After all, the surge in cases has occurred under the current rules. Curbing the spread of COVID-19 requires clear, responsible messages and transparency from our leaders. We're not getting that from Washington or Sacramento. \n"
