Code for my thesis, written for the Cognitive Science BSc program at Aarhus University.

The paper is about the connection between empathy and political polarization, using the Black Lives Matter movement as a case study.

One preprocessed data file exceeded the file sizes allowed by GitHub. This file can be found on this ScienceDirect link: https://silo1.sciencedata.dk/shared/fc31768dfca9c47dbb254d8b7b430468
The file should be added to the ./data/NOW_preprocessed folder.

Due to the full, raw dataset not being publicly available, Step 1. can not be run without the raw data. Starting at Step 2. it is possible to run the Python and R scripts with the provided preporcessed files.
